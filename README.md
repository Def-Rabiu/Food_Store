# Food_Store
Created using an advanced data structure, stacks.
This is a group project of five at the computer science academy, Africa, CSAA_22. This projects incorporates tkinter, PIL library, frontend codind and finally, the stacks data structure; we built a simple food store whereby the user can easily order the available food of his choice and can easily undo the last selected food, following the principle of stacks, LIFO before finalising the order.
